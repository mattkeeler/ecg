	EMACS CONFIGURATION GENERATOR

Find here the source for an Emacs configuration generator website.  It
is written in Common Lisp, and was tested using SBCL[0]. A live
instance should be accessible via

    https://emacs.amodernist.com/

Using GNU Guix[1], you can start a server as follows:

    guix shell --pure -CN -m manifest.scm --			\
    	 sbcl --load ecg.lisp					\
	      --eval "(hunchentoot:start *ecg-acceptor*)"

The server HTTP will now be listening for new requests on port 9095.

Questions, issues, complaints, comments, insults, patches, etc. should
be sent to

    ~pkal/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht

The site has been tested (to differing degrees) with the following
browers:

- GNU IceCat (91.7.0esr)
- Mozilla Firefox (91.7.0esr)
- eww (Emacs 29.0.50)
- netsurf (3.10)
- Google Chromium (99.0.4844.74)
- Fennec F-Droid (98.2.0)
